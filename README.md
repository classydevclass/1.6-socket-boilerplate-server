# Express Socker Boilerplate
Welcome to Socket.io! This boilerplate will begin the process we need to setup our Express server to deliver a websocket using socket.io.

## Running The App
To begin the server, simply run the following code:

```js
node app
```

## Future Use
We will build out this repo to supply our Poker app game data over time.
